# Healthcare_Symptom_Checker
Healthcare Symptom Checker is an AI-powered web application that helps users understand their symptoms and provides structured, educational summaries.
It analyzes the userâ€™s input using the Google Gemini API, then returns likely conditions, recommended next steps, and a medical disclaimer.
All queries are stored in a local SQLite database for history and analysis.
